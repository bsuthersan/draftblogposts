Title: Data driven parenting: Using rvest and tidytext to evaluate a baby bath
---

Like many soon-to-be parents, my husband and I are currently trying to navigate all the new products we need to buy before the little chap makes his arrival...clothes, wraps, nappy changing tables, you name it. One of the new things we'll need is a baby bath, as we don't have a separate bath at our current place. 

One baby bath I really liked the look of was [this fold-up baby bath](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Puj-PUJ-TUB-WHITE-The-Bathing-Tub/dp/B002WWF4IM). My husband liked it also, but he was also concerned about the baby growing out of it quickly. A short argument ensued, and yada yada yada, I decided to check if there was any hard data out there to check for how long we might expect the bath to last.
